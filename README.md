# apx-rpmbuild

This tool provides a convenient way to automatically package RPMs with version data from git-describe.  It handles conversion between [Semantic Versions](http://semver.org) and RPM-compatible versions as well as stamping builds of untagged revisions and keeping them in natural sequence.

This tool is intended to obsolete ugly template code in APx card software makefiles.
